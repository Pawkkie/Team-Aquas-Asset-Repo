# TAAR's Tilesets

## The Great Tileset Exchange
This folder is for individual tiles and full tilesets that are:

- Finished
- Easily insertable into pokeeemrald

This is the companion folder to The Great Tileset Exchange [wiki page](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki/The-Great-Tileset-Exchange), where contributors work together as a community to improve the tilesets that are available for all of us to use. The wiki page also covers how to export and import Exchange tilesets into porymap.

If you're submitting assets for the Exchange, please put them in here!

## Other Tilesets
These tilesets, while awesome, may require significant additional work to insert into pokeemerald. This may include:

- Palette overhauls
- Indexing
- Resizing
- Reformatting

All of these are excellent to be used as a base, though they are likely to need some additional work to use.
