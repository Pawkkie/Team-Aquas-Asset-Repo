# TAAR's Tilesets

## The Great Tileset Exchange
This folder is for individual tiles and full tilesets that are:

- Finished
- Easily insertable into pokeeemrald

This is the companion folder to The Great Tileset Exchange [wiki page](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki/The-Great-Tileset-Exchange), where contributors work together as a community to improve the tilesets that are available for all of us to use. If you're submitting assets for the Exchange, please put them in here!

# Other Tilesets
These tilesets, while awesome, may require significant additional work to insert into pokeemerald. This may include:

- Palette overhauls
- Indexing
- Resizing
- Reformatting

All of these are excellent to be used as a base, though they are likely to need some additional work to use.
